# Hello Y'll! ðŸ‘‹

About Me!

I am SAI HARNADH, masters graduate from University of Ottawa in Electrical and Computer Science Engineering. I also have my bachelors degree from JNTU in Electronics and Communications Engineering. Personally, I am software enthusiast who is always open to learn new technologies and update my skills. I have 3 years of software development experience mainly focusing on JS based frameworks like React and Angular. I also have hands on experience working with Node, C#, ASP.NET and Entity framework to create data objects and for building other backend requirements of the applications along with relational databases like SSMS(sql server management studio) and Azure DB Studio by implementing SQL quires. Designing for web/mobile layouts is an added skill I learned in my career where I worked with tools like Figma and AdobeXD. Apart from these, I acquired sound knowledge on Azure Devops platform which I used for multiple development practices starting from Azure Boards for Project management by following best AGILE methodologies, followed by Azure Repos configured with GIT principles for Continuous Integrations and Pull Requests and finally, I have used Azure Pipelines for continuous deployments of automated pipelines written in YAML and pushing the changes to the Production environment. Adding on, in my recent work place I have contributed in developing EMAIL Templates for all major ESP (Email service providers) for sales and marketing all alone by myself. My core motivations to apply for this position mainly are my skills which mostly align to the job requirements, my passion to work with talented a team who can guide me to scale my career and my personal responsibility to contribute in healthcare industry and be a part of solution to the societal needs. Since most of my previous work experiences are with small scale startup organization I acquired the ability to work under pressure with tight deadlines, managing with minimum resources, moulding to any kind of  team environment and basically I like to work under multiple hats.
